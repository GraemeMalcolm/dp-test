## Lab setup and pre-requisites

- You have successfully completed [Module 0](../00/README.md) to create your lab environment.

## Exercise 0: Start the dedicated SQL pool

This lab uses the dedicated SQL pool. As a first step, make sure it is not paused. If so, start it by following these instructions:

1. Open Synapse Studio (<https://web.azuresynapse.net/>).

2. Select the **Manage** hub.

    ![The manage hub is highlighted.](images/manage-hub.png "Manage hub")

3. Select **SQL pools** in the left-hand menu **(1)**. If the dedicated SQL pool is paused, hover over the name of the pool and select **Resume (2)**.

    ![The resume button is highlighted on the dedicated SQL pool.](images/resume-dedicated-sql-pool.png "Resume")

4. When prompted, select **Resume**. It will take a minute or two to resume the pool.

    ![The resume button is highlighted.](images/resume-dedicated-sql-pool-confirm.png "Resume")

> **Continue to the next exercise** while the dedicated SQL pool resumes.

## Lab 1: Code-free transformation at scale with Azure Synapse Pipelines

Tailwind Traders would like code-free options for data engineering tasks. Their motivation is driven by the desire to allow junior-level data engineers who understand the data but do not have a lot of development experience build and maintain data transformation operations. The other driver for this requirement is to reduce fragility caused by complex code with reliance on libraries pinned to specific versions, remove code testing requirements, and improve ease of long-term maintenance.

Their other requirement is to maintain transformed data in a data lake in addition to the dedicated SQL pool. This gives them the flexibility to retain more fields in their data sets than they otherwise store in fact and dimension tables, and doing this allows them to access the data when they have paused the dedicated SQL pool, as a cost optimization.

Given these requirements, you recommend building Mapping Data Flows.

Mapping Data flows are pipeline activities that provide a visual way of specifying how to transform data, through a code-free experience. This feature offers data cleansing, transformation, aggregation, conversion, joins, data copy operations, etc.

Additional benefits

- Cloud scale via Spark execution
- Guided experience to easily build resilient data flows
- Flexibility to transform data per userâ€™s comfort
- Monitor and manage data flows from a single pane of glass

### Exercise 1: Create artifacts

#### Task 1: Create SQL table

The Mapping Data Flow we will build will write user purchase data to a dedicated SQL pool. Tailwind Traders does not yet have a table to store this data. We will execute a SQL script to create this table as a pre-requisite.

1. Open Synapse Analytics Studio (<https://web.azuresynapse.net/>), and then navigate to the **Develop** hub.

    ![The Develop menu item is highlighted.](images/develop-hub.png "Develop hub")

2. From the **Develop** menu, select the **+** button **(1)** and choose **SQL Script (2)** from the context menu.

    ![The SQL script context menu item is highlighted.](images/synapse-studio-new-sql-script.png "New SQL script")

3. In the toolbar menu, connect to the **SQLPool01** database to execute the query.

    ![The connect to option is highlighted in the query toolbar.](images/synapse-studio-query-toolbar-connect.png "Query toolbar")

4. In the query window, replace the script with the following to create a new table that joins users' preferred products stored in Azure Cosmos DB with top product purchases per user from the e-commerce site, stored in JSON files within the data lake:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE [wwi].[UserTopProductPurchases]
    (
        [UserId] [int]  NOT NULL,
        [ProductId] [int]  NOT NULL,
        [ItemsPurchasedLast12Months] [int]  NULL,
        [IsTopProduct] [bit]  NOT NULL,
        [IsPreferredProduct] [bit]  NOT NULL
    )
    WITH
    (
        DISTRIBUTION = HASH ( [UserId] ),
        CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
    )
    ```

5. Select **Run** from the toolbar menu to execute the SQL command.

    ![The run button is highlighted in the query toolbar.](images/synapse-studio-query-toolbar-run.png "Run")

6. In the query window, replace the script with the following to create a new table for the Campaign Analytics CSV file:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE [wwi].[CampaignAnalytics]
    (
        [Region] [nvarchar](50)  NOT NULL,
        [Country] [nvarchar](30)  NOT NULL,
        [ProductCategory] [nvarchar](50)  NOT NULL,
        [CampaignName] [nvarchar](500)  NOT NULL,
        [Revenue] [decimal](10,2)  NULL,
        [RevenueTarget] [decimal](10,2)  NULL,
        [City] [nvarchar](50)  NULL,
        [State] [nvarchar](25)  NULL
    )
    WITH
    (
        DISTRIBUTION = HASH ( [Region] ),
        CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
    )
    ```

7. Select **Run** from the toolbar menu to execute the SQL command.

    ![The run button is highlighted in the query toolbar.](images/synapse-studio-query-toolbar-run.png "Run")

#### Task 2: Create linked service

Azure Cosmos DB is one of the data sources that will be used in the Mapping Data Flow. Tailwind Traders has not yet created the linked service. Follow the steps in this section to create one.

> **Note**: Skip this section if you have already created a Cosmos DB linked service.

1. Navigate to the **Manage** hub.

    ![The Manage menu item is highlighted.](images/manage-hub.png "Manage hub")

2. Open **Linked services** and select **+ New** to create a new linked service. Select **Azure Cosmos DB (SQL API)** in the list of options, then select **Continue**.

    ![Manage, New, and the Azure Cosmos DB linked service option are highlighted.](images/create-cosmos-db-linked-service-step1.png "New linked service")

3. Name the linked service `asacosmosdb01` **(1)**, select the **Cosmos DB account name** (`asacosmosdbSUFFIX`) and set the **Database name** value to `CustomerProfile` **(2)**. Select **Test connection** to ensure success **(3)**, then select **Create (4)**.

    ![New Azure Cosmos DB linked service.](images/create-cosmos-db-linked-service.png "New linked service")

#### Task 3: Create data sets

User profile data comes from two different data sources, which we will create now: `asal400_ecommerce_userprofiles_source` and `asal400_customerprofile_cosmosdb`. The customer profile data from an e-commerce system that provides top product purchases for each visitor of the site (customer) over the past 12 months is stored within JSON files in the data lake. User profile data containing, among other things, product preferences and product reviews is stored as JSON documents in Cosmos DB.

In this section, you'll create datasets for the SQL tables that will serve as data sinks for data pipelines you'll create later in this lab.

Complete the steps below to create the following two datasets: `asal400_ecommerce_userprofiles_source` and `asal400_customerprofile_cosmosdb`.

1. Navigate to the **Data** hub.

    ![The Data menu item is highlighted.](images/data-hub.png "Data hub")

3. Select **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** from the list **(1)**, then select **Continue (2)**.

    ![The ADLS Gen2 option is highlighted.](images/new-adls-dataset.png "Integration dataset")

4. Select the **DelimitedText** format **(1)**, then select **Continue (2)**.

    ![The DelimitedText format is selected.](images/delimited-text-format.png "Select format")

5. Configure the dataset with the following characteristics, then select **OK (6)**:

    - **Name**: Enter `asal400_campaign_analytics_source` **(1)**.
    - **Linked service**: Select the `asadatalakeSUFFIX` linked service **(2)**.
    - **File path**: Browse to the `wwi-02/campaign-analytics/campaignanalytics.csv` path **(3)**.
    - **First row as header**: Leave `unchecked` **(4)**. **We are skipping the header** because there is a mismatch between the number of columns in the header and the number of columns in the data rows.
    - **Import schema**: Select `From connection/store` **(5)**.

    ![The form is configured as described.](images/new-adls-dataset-form-delimited.png "Set properties")

6. After creating the dataset, navigate to its **Connection** tab. Leave the default settings. They should match the following configuration:

    - **Compression type**: Select `none`.
    - **Column delimiter**: Select `Comma (,)`.
    - **Row delimiter**: Select `Default (\r,\n, or \r\n)`.
    - **Encoding**: Select `Default(UTF-8).
    - **Escape character**: Select `Backslash (\)`.
    - **Quote character**: Select `Double quote (")`.
    - **First row as header**: Leave `unchecked`.
    - **Null value**: Leave the field empty.

    ![The configuration settings under Connection are set as defined.](images/campaign-analytics-dataset-connection.png "Connection")

7. Select **Preview data**.

8. Preview data displays a sample of the CSV file. You can see some of the issues shown in the screenshot at the beginning of this task. Notice that since we are not setting the first row as the header, the header columns appear as the first row. Also, notice that the city and state values seen in the earlier screenshot do not appear. This is because of the mismatch in the number of columns in the header row compared to the rest of the file. We will exclude the first row when we create the data flow in the next exercise.

    ![A preview of the CSV file is displayed.](images/campaign-analytics-dataset-preview-data.png "Preview data")

9. Select **Publish all** then **Publish** to save your new resources.

    ![Publish all is highlighted.](images/publish-all-1.png "Publish all")

### Exercise 2: Create data pipeline to import poorly formatted CSV

#### Task 1: Create campaign analytics data flow

1. Navigate to the **Develop** hub.

    ![The Develop menu item is highlighted.](images/develop-hub.png "Develop hub")

2. Select + then **Data flow** to create a new data flow.

    ![The new data flow link is highlighted.](images/new-data-flow-link.png "New data flow")

3. In the **General** settings of the **Properties** blade of the new data flow, update the **Name** to the following: `asal400_lab2_writecampaignanalyticstoasa`.

    ![The name field is populated with the defined value.](images/data-flow-campaign-analysis-name.png "Name")

4. Select **Add Source** on the data flow canvas.

    ![Select Add Source on the data flow canvas.](images/data-flow-canvas-add-source.png "Add Source")

5. Under **Source settings**, configure the following:

    - **Output stream name**: Enter `CampaignAnalytics`.
    - **Source type**: Select `Integration dataset`.
    - **Dataset**: Select `asal400_campaign_analytics_source`.
    - **Options**: Select `Allow schema drift` and leave the other options unchecked.
    - **Skip line count**: Enter `1`. This allows us to skip the header row which has two fewer columns than the rest of the rows in the CSV file, truncating the last two data columns.
    - **Sampling**: Select `Disable`.

    ![The form is configured with the defined settings.](images/data-flow-campaign-analysis-source-settings.png "Source settings")

6. When you create data flows, certain features are enabled by turning on debug, such as previewing data and importing a schema (projection). Due to the amount of time it takes to enable this option, as well as environmental constraints of the lab environment, we will bypass these features. The data source has a schema we need to set. To do this, select **Script** above the design canvas.

    ![The script link is highlighted above the canvas.](images/data-flow-script.png "Script")

7. Replace the script with the following to provide the column mappings (`output`), then select **OK**:

    ```json
    source(output(
            {_col0_} as string,
            {_col1_} as string,
            {_col2_} as string,
            {_col3_} as string,
            {_col4_} as string,
            {_col5_} as double,
            {_col6_} as string,
            {_col7_} as double,
            {_col8_} as string,
            {_col9_} as string
        ),
        allowSchemaDrift: true,
        validateSchema: false,
        ignoreNoFilesFound: false) ~> CampaignAnalytics
    ```

    Your script should match the following:

    ![The script columns are highlighted.](images/data-flow-script-columns.png "Script")

3. Right-click the `wwi.CampaignAnalytics` table, then select the **Select TOP 1000 rows** menu item under the New SQL script context menu. You may need to refresh to see the new tables.

    ![The Select TOP 1000 rows menu item is highlighted.](images/select-top-1000-rows-campaign-analytics.png "Select TOP 1000 rows")

4. The properly transformed data should appear in the query results.

    ![The CampaignAnalytics query results are displayed.](images/campaign-analytics-query-results.png "Query results")

5. Update the query to the following and **Run**:

    ```sql
    SELECT ProductCategory
    ,SUM(Revenue) AS TotalRevenue
    ,SUM(RevenueTarget) AS TotalRevenueTarget
    ,(SUM(RevenueTarget) - SUM(Revenue)) AS Delta
    FROM [wwi].[CampaignAnalytics]
    GROUP BY ProductCategory
    ```

6. In the query results, select the **Chart** view. Configure the columns as defined:

    - **Chart type**: Select `Column`.
    - **Category column**: Select `ProductCategory`.
    - **Legend (series) columns**: Select `TotalRevenue`, `TotalRevenueTarget`, and `Delta`.

### Exercise 3: Create Mapping Data Flow for top product purchases

Tailwind Traders needs to combine top product purchases imported as JSON files from their eCommerce system with user preferred products from profile data stored as JSON documents in Azure Cosmos DB. They want to store the combined data in a dedicated SQL pool as well as their data lake for further analysis and reporting.

To do this, you will build a mapping data flow that performs the following tasks:

- Adds two ADLS Gen2 data sources for the JSON data
- Flattens the hierarchical structure of both sets of files
- Performs data transformations and type conversions
- Joins both data sources
- Creates new fields on the joined data set based on conditional logic
- Filters null records for required fields
- Writes to the dedicated SQL pool
- Simultaneously writes to the data lake

#### Task 1: Create Mapping Data Flow

1. Navigate to the **Develop** hub.

    ![The Develop menu item is highlighted.](images/develop-hub.png "Develop hub")

2. Select **+** then **Data flow** to create a new data flow.

    ![The new data flow link is highlighted.](images/new-data-flow-link.png "New data flow")

3. In the **General** section of the **Profiles** pane of the new data flow, update the **Name** to the following: `write_user_profile_to_asa`.

    ![The name is displayed.](images/data-flow-general.png "General properties")

4. Select the **Properties** button to hide the pane.

    ![The button is highlighted.](images/data-flow-properties-button.png "Properties button")

5. Select **Add Source** on the data flow canvas.

    ![Select Add Source on the data flow canvas.](images/data-flow-canvas-add-source.png "Add Source")

6. Under **Source settings**, configure the following:

    - **Output stream name**: Enter `EcommerceUserProfiles`.
    - **Source type**: Select `Integration dataset`.
    - **Dataset**: Select `asal400_ecommerce_userprofiles_source`.

        ![The source settings are configured as described.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-source-settings.png "Source settings")

7. Select the **Source options** tab, then configure the following:

    - **Wildcard paths**: Enter `online-user-profiles-02/*.json`.
    - **JSON Settings**: Expand this section, then select the **Array of documents** setting. This denotes that each file contains an array of JSON documents.

        ![The source options are configured as described.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-source-options.png "Source options")

8. Select the **+** to the right of the `EcommerceUserProfiles` source, then select the **Derived Column** schema modifier from the context menu.

    ![The plus sign and Derived Column schema modifier are highlighted.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-new-derived-column.png "New Derived Column")

9. Under **Derived column's settings**, configure the following:

    - **Output stream name**: Enter `userId`.
    - **Incoming stream**: Select `EcommerceUserProfiles`.
    - **Columns**: Provide the following information:

        | Column | Expression | Description |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | visitorId | `toInteger(visitorId)` | Converts the `visitorId` column from a string to an integer. |

        ![The derived column's settings are configured as described.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-derived-column-settings.png "Derived column's settings")

10. Select the **+** to the right of the `userId` step, then select the **Flatten** formatter from the context menu.

    ![The plus sign and the Flatten schema modifier are highlighted.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-new-flatten.png "New Flatten schema modifier")

11. Under **Flatten settings**, configure the following:

    - **Output stream name**: Enter `UserTopProducts`.
    - **Incoming stream**: Select `userId`.
    - **Unroll by**: Select `[] topProductPurchases`.
    - **Input columns**: Provide the following information:

        | userId's column | Name as |
        | --- | --- |
        | visitorId | `visitorId` |
        | topProductPurchases.productId | `productId` |
        | topProductPurchases.itemsPurchasedLast12Months | `itemsPurchasedLast12Months` |

        > Select **+ Add mapping**, then select **Fixed mapping** to add each new column mapping.

        ![The flatten settings are configured as described.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-flatten-settings.png "Flatten settings")

    These settings provide a flattened view of the data source with one or more rows per `visitorId`, similar to when we explored the data within the Spark notebook in the previous module. Using data preview requires you to enable Debug mode, which we are not enabling for this lab. *The following screenshot is for illustration only*:

    ![The data preview tab is displayed with a sample of the file contents.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-flatten-data-preview.png "Data preview")

    > **IMPORTANT**: A bug was introduced with the latest release, and the userId source columns are not being updated from the user interface. As a temporary fix, access the script for the data flow (located in the toolbar). Find the `userId` activity in the script, and in the mapColumn function, ensure you append the appropriate source field. For `productId`, ensure it is sourced from **topProductPurchases.productId**, and that **itemsPurchasedLast12Months** is sourced from **topProductPurchases.itemsPurchasedLast12Months**.

    ![Data flow script button.](images/dataflowactivityscript.png "Data flow script button")

    ```javascript
    userId foldDown(unroll(topProductPurchases),
        mapColumn(
            visitorId,
            productId = topProductPurchases.productId,
            itemsPurchasedLast12Months = topProductPurchases.itemsPurchasedLast12Months
        )
    ```

    ![The script for the data flow is displayed with the userId portion identified and the property names added are highlighted.](images/appendpropertynames_script.png "Data flow script")

12. Select the **+** to the right of the `UserTopProducts` step, then select the **Derived Column** schema modifier from the context menu.

    ![The plus sign and Derived Column schema modifier are highlighted.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-new-derived-column2.png "New Derived Column")

13. Under **Derived column's settings**, configure the following:

    - **Output stream name**: Enter `DeriveProductColumns`.
    - **Incoming stream**: Select `UserTopProducts`.
    - **Columns**: Provide the following information:

        | Column | Expression | Description |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | productId | `toInteger(productId)` | Converts the `productId` column from a string to an integer. |
        | itemsPurchasedLast12Months | `toInteger(itemsPurchasedLast12Months)` | Converts the `itemsPurchasedLast12Months` column from a string to an integer. |

        ![The derived column's settings are configured as described.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-derived-column2-settings.png "Derived column's settings")

        > **Note**: To add a column to the derived column settings, select **+** to the right of the first column, then select **Add column**.

        ![The add column menu item is highlighted.](images/data-flow-add-derived-column.png "Add derived column")

14. Select **Add Source** on the data flow canvas beneath the `EcommerceUserProfiles` source.

    ![Select Add Source on the data flow canvas.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-add-source.png "Add Source")

15. Under **Source settings**, configure the following:

    - **Output stream name**: Enter `UserProfiles`.
    - **Source type**: Select `Integration dataset`.
    - **Dataset**: Select `asal400_customerprofile_cosmosdb`.

        ![The source settings are configured as described.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-source2-settings.png "Source settings")

16. Since we are not using the data flow debugger, we need to enter the data flow's Script view to update the source projection. Select **Script** in the toolbar above the canvas.

    ![The Script link is highlighted above the canvas.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-script-link.png "Data flow canvas")

17. Locate the **UserProfiles** `source` in the script and replace its script block with the following to set `preferredProducts` as an `integer[]` array and ensure the data types within the `productReviews` array are correctly defined:

    ```json
    source(output(
            cartId as string,
            preferredProducts as integer[],
            productReviews as (productId as integer, reviewDate as string, reviewText as string)[],
            userId as integer
        ),
        allowSchemaDrift: true,
        validateSchema: false,
        ignoreNoFilesFound: false,
        format: 'document') ~> UserProfiles
    ```

    ![The script view is displayed.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-script.png "Script view")

18. Select **OK** to apply the script changes. The data source has now been updated with the new schema. The following screenshot shows what the source data looks like if you are able to view it with the data preview option. Using data preview requires you to enable Debug mode, which we are not enabling for this lab. *The following screenshot is for illustration only*:

    ![The data preview tab is displayed with a sample of the file contents.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-data-preview2.png "Data preview")

19. Select the **+** to the right of the `UserProfiles` source, then select the **Flatten** formatter from the context menu.

    ![The plus sign and the Flatten schema modifier are highlighted.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-new-flatten2.png "New Flatten schema modifier")

20. Under **Flatten settings**, configure the following:

    - **Output stream name**: Enter `UserPreferredProducts`.
    - **Incoming stream**: Select `UserProfiles`.
    - **Unroll by**: Select `[] preferredProducts`.
    - **Input columns**: Provide the following information. Be sure to **delete** `cartId` and `[] productReviews`:

        | UserProfiles's column | Name as |
        | --- | --- |
        | [] preferredProducts | `preferredProductId` |
        | userId | `userId` |

        > Select **+ Add mapping**, then select **Fixed mapping** to add each new column mapping.

        ![The flatten settings are configured as described.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-flatten2-settings.png "Flatten settings")

        These settings provide a flattened view of the data source with one or more rows per `userId`. Using data preview requires you to enable Debug mode, which we are not enabling for this lab. *The following screenshot is for illustration only*:

        ![The data preview tab is displayed with a sample of the file contents.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-flatten2-data-preview.png "Data preview")

21. Now it is time to join the two data sources. Select the **+** to the right of the `DeriveProductColumns` step, then select the **Join** option from the context menu.

    ![The plus sign and new Join menu item are highlighted.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-new-join.png "New Join")

22. Under **Join settings**, configure the following:

    - **Output stream name**: Enter `JoinTopProductsWithPreferredProducts`.
    - **Left stream**: Select `DeriveProductColumns`.
    - **Right stream**: Select `UserPreferredProducts`.
    - **Join type**: Select `Full outer`.
    - **Join conditions**: Provide the following information:

        | Left: DeriveProductColumns's column | Right: UserPreferredProducts's column |
        | --- | --- |
        | `visitorId` | `userId` |

        ![The join settings are configured as described.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-join-settings.png "Join settings")

23. Select **Optimize** and configure the following:

    - **Broadcast options**: Check `Left: 'DeriveProductColumns'`.
    - **Partition option**: Select `Set partitioning`.
    - **Partition type**: Select `Hash`.
    - **Number of partitions**: Enter `30`.
    - **Column**: Select `productId`.

        ![The join optimization settings are configured as described.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-join-optimize.png "Optimize")

    <!-- **TODO**: Add optimization description. -->

24. Select the **Inspect** tab to see the join mapping, including the column feed source and whether the column is used in a join.

    ![The inspect blade is displayed.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-join-inspect.png "Inspect")

    **For illustrative purposes of data preview only:** Since we are not turning on data flow debugging, do not perform this step. In this small sample of data, likely the `userId` and `preferredProductId` columns will only show null values. If you want to get a sense of how many records contain values for these fields, select a column, such as `preferredProductId`, then select **Statistics** in the toolbar above. This displays a chart for the column showing the ratio of values.

    ![The data preview results are shown and the statistics for the preferredProductId column is displayed as a pie chart to the right.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-join-preview.png "Data preview")

25. Select the **+** to the right of the `JoinTopProductsWithPreferredProducts` step, then select the **Derived Column** schema modifier from the context menu.

    ![The plus sign and Derived Column schema modifier are highlighted.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-new-derived-column3.png "New Derived Column")

26. Under **Derived column's settings**, configure the following:

    - **Output stream name**: Enter `DerivedColumnsForMerge`.
    - **Incoming stream**: Select `JoinTopProductsWithPreferredProducts`.
    - **Columns**: Provide the following information (**_type in_ the _first two_ column names**):

        | Column | Expression | Description |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | isTopProduct | `toBoolean(iif(isNull(productId), 'false', 'true'))` | Returns `true` if `productId` is not null. Recall that `productId` is fed by the e-commerce top user products data lineage. |
        | isPreferredProduct | `toBoolean(iif(isNull(preferredProductId), 'false', 'true'))` | Returns `true` if `preferredProductId` is not null. Recall that `preferredProductId` is fed by the Azure Cosmos DB user profile data lineage. |
        | productId | `iif(isNull(productId), preferredProductId, productId)` | Sets the `productId` output to either the `preferredProductId` or `productId` value, depending on whether `productId` is null.
        | userId | `iif(isNull(userId), visitorId, userId)` | Sets the `userId` output to either the `visitorId` or `userId` value, depending on whether `userId` is null.

        ![The derived column's settings are configured as described.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-derived-column3-settings.png "Derived column's settings")

        > **Note**: Remember, select **+**, then **Add column** to the right of a derived column to add a new column below.

        ![The plus and add column menu item are both highlighted.](images/data-flow-add-new-derived-column.png "Add column")

        The derived column settings provide the following result:

        ![The data preview is displayed.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-derived-column3-preview.png "Data preview")

27. Select the **+** to the right of the `DerivedColumnsForMerge` step, then select the **Filter** destination from the context menu.

    ![The new Filter destination is highlighted.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-new-filter.png "New filter")

    We are adding the Filter step to remove any records where the `ProductId` is null. The data sets have a small percentage of invalid records, and null `ProductId` values will cause errors when loading into the `UserTopProductPurchases` dedicated SQL pool table.

28. Set the **Filter on** expression to **`!isNull(productId)`**.

    ![The filter settings are shown.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-new-filter-settings.png "Filter settings")

29. Select the **+** to the right of the `Filter1` step, then select the **Sink** destination from the context menu.

    - **Options**: Check `Allow schema drift` and uncheck `Validate schema`.

    ![The sink settings are shown.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-new-sink-settings.png "Sink settings")

31. Select **Settings**, then configure the following:

    - **Update method**: Check `Allow insert` and leave the rest unchecked.
    - **Table action**: Select `Truncate table`.
    - **Enable staging**: `Check` this option. Since we are importing a lot of data, we want to enable staging to improve performance.

        ![The settings are shown.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-new-sink-settings-options.png "Settings")

32. Select **Mapping**, then configure the following:

    - **Auto mapping**: `Uncheck` this option.
    - **Columns**: Provide the following information:

        | Input columns | Output columns |
        | --- | --- |

    - **Incoming stream**: Select `Filter1`.
    - **Sink type**: select `Inline`.
    - **Inline dataset type**: select `Delta`.
    - **Linked service**: Select the default workspace data lake storage account (example: `asaworkspaceinaday84-WorspaceDefaultStorage`).
    - **Options**: Check `Allow schema drift` and uncheck `Validate schema`.

        ![The sink settings are shown.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-new-sink-settings2.png "Sink settings")

35. Select **Settings**, then configure the following:

    - **Folder path**: Enter `wwi-02/top-products` (**copy and paste** these two values into the fields since the `top-products` folder does not yet exist).
    - **Compression type**: Select `snappy`.
    - **Compression level**: Select `Fastest`.
    - **Vacuum**: Enter 0.
    - **Truncate table**: Select.
    - **Update method**: Check `Allow insert` and leave the rest unchecked.
    - **Merge schema (under Delta options)**: Unchecked.

        ![The settings are shown.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-new-sink-settings-options2.png "Settings")

        ![The mapping settings are configured as described.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-new-sink-settings-mapping2.png "Mapping")

        > Notice that we have chosen to keep more fields for the data lake sink vs. the SQL pool sink (`visitorId` and `preferredProductId`). This is because we aren't adhering to a fixed destination schema (like a SQL table), and because we want to retain the original data as much as possible in the data lake.

37. Your completed data flow should look similar to the following:

    ![The completed data flow is displayed.](images/data-flow-user-profiles-complete.png "Completed data flow")

38. Select **Publish all**, then **Publish** to save your new data flow.

    ![Publish all is highlighted.](images/publish-all-1.png "Publish all")

## Lab 2: Orchestrate data movement and transformation in Azure Synapse Pipelines

Tailwind Traders is familiar with Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipelines and wants to know if Azure Synapse Analytics can either integrate with ADF or has a similar capability. They want to orchestrate data ingest, transformation, and load activities across their entire data catalog, both internal and external to their data warehouse.

You recommend using Synapse Pipelines, which includes over 90 built-in connectors, can load data by manual execution of the pipeline or by orchestration, supports common loading patterns, enables fully parallel loading into the data lake or SQL tables, and shares a code base with ADF.

By using Synapse Pipelines, Tailwind Traders can experience the same familiar interface as ADF without having to use an orchestration service outside of Azure Synapse Analytics.

### Exercise 1: Create, trigger, and monitor pipeline

#### Task 1: Create pipeline

Let's start by executing our new Mapping Data Flow. In order to run the new data flow, we need to create a new pipeline and add a data flow activity to it.

1. Navigate to the **Integrate** hub.

    ![The Integrate hub is highlighted.](images/integrate-hub.png "Integrate hub")

2. Select **+ (1)**, then **Pipeline (2)**.

    ![The new pipeline menu item is highlighted.](images/new-pipeline.png "New pipeline")

3. In the **General** section of the **Profiles** pane of the new data flow, update the **Name** to the following: `Write User Profile Data to ASA`.

    ![The name is displayed.](images/pipeline-general.png "General properties")

4. Select the **Properties** button to hide the pane.

    ![The button is highlighted.](images/pipeline-properties-button.png "Properties button")

5. Expand **Move & transform** within the Activities list, then drag the **Data flow** activity onto the pipeline canvas.

    ![Drag the data flow activity onto the pipeline canvas.](images/pipeline-drag-data-flow.png "Pipeline canvas")

6. Under the **General** tab, set the Name to `write_user_profile_to_asa`.

    ![The name is set on the general tab as described.](images/pipeline-data-flow-general.png "Name on the General tab")

7. Select the **Settings** tab **(1)**. Select `write_user_profile_to_asa` for **Data flow (2)**, then ensure `AutoResolveIntegrationRuntime` is selected for **Run on (Azure IR) (3)**. Choose the `General purpose` **Compute type (4)** and select `8 (+ 8 cores)` for the **Core count (5)**.

    ![The settings are configured as described.](images/data-flow-activity-settings1.png "Settings")

8. Expand **Staging** and configure the following:

    - **Staging linked service**: Select the `asadatalakeSUFFIX` linked service.
    - **Staging storage folder**: Enter `staging/userprofiles`. The `userprofiles` folder will be automatically created for you during the first pipeline run.

        > **Copy and paste** the `staging` and `userprofiles` folder names into the two fields.

        ![The mapping data flow activity settings are configured as described.](images/pipeline-user-profiles-data-flow-settings.png "Mapping data flow activity settings")

        The staging options under PolyBase are recommended when you have a large amount of data to move into or out of Azure Synapse Analytics. You will want to experiment with enabling and disabling staging on the data flow in a production environment to evaluate the difference in performance.

9. Select **Publish all** then **Publish** to save your pipeline.

    ![Publish all is highlighted.](images/publish-all-1.png "Publish all")

#### Task 2: Trigger, monitor, and analyze the user profile data pipeline

Tailwind Traders wants to monitor all pipeline runs and view statistics for performance tuning and troubleshooting purposes.

You have decided to show Tailwind Traders how to manually trigger, monitor, then analyze a pipeline run.

1. At the top of the pipeline, select **Add trigger (1)**, then **Trigger now (2)**.

    ![The pipeline trigger option is highlighted.](images/pipeline-user-profiles-trigger.png "Trigger now")

2. There are no parameters for this pipeline, so select **OK** to run the trigger.

    ![The OK button is highlighted.](images/pipeline-run-trigger.png "Pipeline run")

3. Navigate to the **Monitor** hub.

    ![The Monitor hub menu item is selected.](images/monitor-hub.png "Monitor hub")

4. Select **Pipeline runs (1)** and wait for the pipeline run to successfully complete **(2)**. You may need to refresh **(3)** the view.

    > While this is running, read the rest of the lab instructions to familiarize yourself with the content.

    ![The pipeline run succeeded.](images/pipeline-user-profiles-run-complete.png "Pipeline runs")

5. Select the name of the pipeline to view the pipeline's activity runs.

    ![The pipeline name is selected.](images/select-pipeline.png "Pipeline runs")

6. Hover over the data flow activity name in the `Activity runs` list, then select the **Data flow details** icon.

    ![The data flow details icon is highlighted.](images/pipeline-user-profiles-activity-runs.png "Activity runs")

7. The data flow details displays the data flow steps and processing details. In our example, processing time took around **44 seconds to process** the SQL pool sink **(1)**, and around **12 seconds to process** the Data Lake sink **(2)**. The Filter1 output was around **1 million rows (3)** for both. You can see which activities took the longest to complete. The cluster startup time contributed over **2.5 minutes (4)** to the total pipeline run.

    ![The data flow details are displayed.](images/pipeline-user-profiles-data-flow-details.png "Data flow details")

8. Select the `UserTopProductPurchasesASA` sink **(1)** to view its details. We can see that **1,622,203 rows** were calculated **(2)** with a total of 30 partitions. It took around **eight seconds** to stage the data **(3)** in ADLS Gen2 prior to writing the data to the SQL table. The total sink processing time in our case was around **44 seconds (4)**. It is also apparent that we have a **hot partition (5)** that is significantly larger than the others. If we need to squeeze extra performance out of this pipeline, we can re-evaluate data partitioning to more evenly spread the partitions to better facilitate parallel data loading and filtering. We could also experiment with disabling staging to see if there's a processing time difference. Finally, the size of the dedicated SQL pool plays a factor in how long it takes to ingest data into the sink.

    ![The sink details are displayed.](images/pipeline-user-profiles-data-flow-sink-details.png "Sink details")

### Exercise 2: Cleanup
