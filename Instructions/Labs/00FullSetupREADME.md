### Task 4: Create Azure resources

Time to complete: 6 minutes

The below ARM template deploys several Azure resources for the labs, including Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Databricks, storage accounts, Event Hubs, Stream Analytics, Key Vault, Azure Cosmos DB, etc.

1. Deploy the workspace through the following Azure ARM template (select the button below):

    <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fctesta-oneillmsft%2Fxyz%2Fmain%2FAllfiles%2F00%2Fartifacts%2Fenvironment-setup%2fautomation%2F00-asa-workspace-core.json" target="_blank"><img src="https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton" /></a>

2. On the **Custom deployment** form fill in the fields described below.

   - **Subscription**: Select your desired subscription for the deployment.
   - **Resource group**: Select the resource group you previously created.
   - **Region**: The region where your Azure Synapse environment will be created.

        > **Important**: The `Region` field under 'Parameters' will list the Azure regions where Azure Synapse Analytics is available as of November 2020. This will help you find a region where the service is available without being limited to where the resource group is defined.

   - **Unique Suffix**: This unique suffix will be used naming resources that will created as part of your deployment, such as your initials followed by the current date in YYYYMMDD format (ex. `jdh20210615`). Make sure you follow correct Azure [Resource naming](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging#resource-naming) conventions.
   - **SQL Administrator Login Password**: Provide a strong password for the SQLPool that will be created as part of your deployment. [Visit here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/password-policy?view=sql-server-ver15#password-complexity) to read about password rules in place. Your password will be needed during the next steps. Make sure you have your password noted and secured.

   ![The form is configured as described.](images/synapse-arm-template.png "Deploy an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace")

3. Select the **Review + create** button, then **Create**. The provisioning of your deployment resources will take approximately 6 minutes.

    During workspace creation, the portal displays the Submitting deployment for Azure Databricks tile on the right side. You may need to scroll right on your dashboard to see the tile. There is also a progress bar displayed near the top of the screen. You can watch either area for progress.

    > **Note**: You may experience a deployment step failing in regards to Role Assignment. This error may safely be ignored.

## Exercise 2: Setup Synapse Analytics workspace
